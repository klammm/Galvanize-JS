        <h2>Question 0:</h2>
        <p>Status of JS page Connected: <span id="q0" class="status-bad">NOT connected properly</span></p>
        <hr>



      <h2>Question 1:</h2>
      <p> Q: 1. Output each item in the following Array to your console within their own paragraphs:
      var livingRoom = ['couch', 'lamp', 'rug', 'shelf']; </p>
        <p><span id="q1"></span>
        </p>
        <hr>


        <h2>Question 2:</h2>
        <p>Q: 2. Using a loop, log numbers 22-33 within their own paragraphs.</p>
        <p><span id="q2"></span>
        </p>
        <hr>


        <h2>Question 3:</h2>
        <p>Q: 3. Using a similar loop, log numbers 75 to 100, only in increments of five.</p>
        <p><span id="q3"></span>
        </p>
        <hr>


        <h2>Question 4:</h2>
        <p>Q: 4. Write a while loop that displays paragraphs of "This is how a professional loops." to the HTML page 5 times.</p>
        <p><span id="q4"></span>
        </p>
        <hr>


        <h2>Question 5:</h2>
        <p> 5. Separately, use both a for loop and while loop to do the same thing.
          <br>     Display in unique paragraphs the sentence "At home, I have _____ cats."
          <br>     The numbers should range from 10 to 110, in increments of 25.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's the for loop:
          <span id="q5a"></span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's the while loop:
          <span id="q5b"></span></p>
        <p> In conclusion, there isn't much of a difference. They are both situational -__- </p>

        <h2>Question 6:</h2>
        <p>Q: 6. Given the following Array, display in unique paragraphs'Even' if the number is even, 'Even and greater than 10' if the
            number is even and greater than 10, and 'Odd' if the number is odd.
            <br> var numArray = [2, 17, 9, 24, 8];
        </p>
        <p><span id="q6"></span>
        </p>
        <hr>


        <h2>Question 7:</h2>
        <p>Q: 7. Using the following Array, create variable called numThrees with the value [13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73]
        var numArray = [13, 15, 17, 23, 25, 27, 33, 35, 37, 43, 45, 47, 53, 55, 57, 63, 65, 67, 73, 75, 77];</p>
        <p><span id="q7"></span></p>
        <hr>


        <h2>Question 8:</h2>
        <p>Q: 8. Write a loop that outputs the following to unique paragraphs:
        <br> #
        <br> ##
        <br> ###
        <br> ####
        <br> #####
        <br> ######
        <br> #######</p>
        <p>A: <br><span id="q8"></span></p>
        <hr>


        <h2>Question 9:</h2>
        <p>Q: 9. FIZZ BUZZ
        <br> Write a program that uses console.log to print each number up to 100, with a couple exceptions...
        <br> If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
        <br> If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
        <br> If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.</p>
        <p><span id="q9"></span></p>
        <hr>


        <h2>Question 10 - 15:</h2>
        <p>Q: <br> RO SHAM BO!
        <br> We're going to create a paper, rock, scissors game that prompts you for your choice and allows the computer to
        <br> randomly choose. You will use an alert to define the winner.

        <br> 10. Use a variable called "human" to prompt the user to type their choice.
        <br> 11. Define a variable called "computer" and use Math.random to allow the computer to randomly select a number.
        <br>     For reference:
        <br>     Math.random gives you a random number between 0 and 1, which is different each time you call it.
        <br> 12. Let's start our conditional statement.
        <br>     If the random computer number falls between 0 and .33, the computer is "rock"
        <br>     If the random computer number falls between .34 and .66, the computer is "paper"
        <br>     If the random computer number falls between .67 and 1, the computer is "scissors"
        <br> 13. Using both "human" and the computer choice, begin another conditional statement to compare them.
        <br> 14. After comparing, determine who has won; the computer or the human!
        <br> 15. Give yourself a high five for completing your first javascript game!
        <br> BONUS: What happens if your user enters something other than "rock", "paper", or "scissors?". Change your default case
        <br>     to print a snarky message to the console if the input doesn't match any of the options.</p>
        <p>
          <h2 style="color: blue"> RO SHAM BO </h2>
          <form name="choice">
            Rock, paper, or scissors? Don't be a smartass and choose a sharp rock.
            <input type="text" id="roshambo">
          </form>
          <button id="begin">Let the games begin!</button>
          <br>
          <br><span id="computer-choice"></span>
          <br><span id="winner"></span>
        </p>

        <h2>Question 16:</h2>
        <p>
          Q: 16. Write a conditional statement to find the largest of the numbers in the array provided.
          <br>var largestNum = [-5, -2, -6, 0, -1]
        </p>
        <p><span id="q16"></span></p>
        <hr>


        <h2>Question 17:</h2>
        <p>Q: 17. Use the following variable for your coin flip action:
          <br>     var coin = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2);
          <br>    We're using Math.random again, along with Math.floor.
          <br>   Remember, Math.random gives you a random number between 0 and 1.
          <br>     Calling Math.floor on that number will truncate the decimal, and give you a
          <br>     random number within the bounds of your array. (In this case, our array will only contain two items.)
        </p>
        <p><span id="q17"></span></p>
        <hr>


        <h2>Question 18:</h2>
        <p> Q: 18. Use a do/while loop to keep flipping the coin until you get tails.
        <p><span id="q18"></span></p>
        <hr>


        <h2>Question 19:</h2>
        <p>Q: Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines.
        <br> At each position of the grid there is either a space or a “#” character. The characters should form a chess board.</p>
        <p><span id="q19"></span></p>
        <hr>


        <h2>Question 20</h2>
        <p>Q: When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a variable size = 8 and change the program
         so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.</p>
        <p>
          <form name='q20-form'>
            <br>Width
            <br><input type="number" id="width" min="0">
            <br>Height
            <br><input type="number" id="height" min="0">
          </form>
          <br><br><button id="chess-button">Here's your chessboard!</button>
          <br><span id="q20"></span>
